### History

Back before [Microsoft acquired GitHub][ms-acquires], I dealt with an internal struggle between GitHub and
GitLab. They were both great in their own way but what finally sold me on choosing GitLab as my primary
source repository was:

1. I could have as many private repositories as I'd like.
2. It provided a built-in robust CI/CD pipeline system.
 
At the time I also chose to use S3 as my hosting solution. _What a cluster that is compared to other static hosting 
solutions but I'll leave that tale for a different day_. 

Today, I'm switching over my personal site (this site) to use exclusively GitHub. That means using [GitHub Pages][github-pages]
for static file hosting and [GitHub Actions][github-actions] for CI/CD.

What I'll really be focusing on is how to setup Pages and Actions and not so much the migration process I personally
had to go through.
